# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
create a linked list then create a method that do what supposed  to do then test it . 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
1. append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
1. insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
1. insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
the approach that i used is linked list approach

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
1. the first method called  append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
1. the second method called insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
1. the third method called insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
