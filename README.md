# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement a Hashtable
## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

1. add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
1. get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
1. contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
1. hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- The Big O is o(1) for Time Complexity for all methods.
- The Big O is o(n) for Space Complexity for all methods.
