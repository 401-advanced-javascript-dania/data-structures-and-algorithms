# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Find common values in 2 binary trees.
## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters. Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- The Big O is o(n) for Time Complexity 
- The Big O is o(n) for Space Complexity
