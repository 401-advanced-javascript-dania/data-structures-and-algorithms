# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class.this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface enqueue(value) and dequeue() but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The Big O of the methods is O(1)
1. enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
1. dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
