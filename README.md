# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
create a linked list then create a method that do what supposed  to do then test it . 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
1. create a node class 
1. create a linked list class 
1. Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
1. Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
1. Define a method called toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
the approach that i used is linked list approach

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
1. the first method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
1. the second method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
1. the third method called toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
