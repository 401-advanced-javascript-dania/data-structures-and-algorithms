# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
create a linked list then create a method that do what supposed  to do then test it . 

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## Solution
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
